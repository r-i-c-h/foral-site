Not sure what'll happen here. Not at all...
`<h2> { props.front.heroImagePath }</h2>`
`<h5> c/o { props.site.author } at { props.front.date } </h5>`

## That h5 above me is from the page's frontmatter as well as the site's metadata...

Behold a pull-quote of nonsense lorem ipsumy goodness...

To use a page's **FRONTMATTER** from *within* the same page: Docs say call to `props.pageContext.frontmatter.____`, but that didn't work. Maybe because I have an extra template rendering layer? Using the "secret" `layoutProps._frontmatter.heroImagePath` *did* work for me, but now I've moved the graphql query into the post-layout.js page and pass down `front` and `site` as props through `<MDXRenderer>`... &lt;shruggo&gt;

To use **SITE METADATA** in a post - import graphql and export a `query` that pulls `site{siteMetatdata{ ___`... but putting gQL in this mdx file seemed to freak things out. `:-/`

To use a **REACT COMPONENT** in your MDX: The first line after the `---` of the front matter would be `import { Foo } from 'whatevs'` and then later on just put a line for `<Foo>` wherevs.
